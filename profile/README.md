# Flux
Flux is an upcoming full-stack web framework for JavaScript, written with Bun, to bring you a fast and enjoyable experience.

We're very early in development. Most work right now will be dedicated to implementing a basic idea of the features we plan to bring. For more information, and to see our planned features, please see our [roadmap](https://go.proudparrot2.com/flux).
